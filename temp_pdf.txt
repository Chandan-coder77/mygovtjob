Adversity  like  that  faced  by  the  Swiss  watchmakers  has  the  virtue  of  starkly 
limiting the alternatives. A company that decides to expand by acquisition has the 
wide  world  of  commerce  before  it,  subject  only to  availability  and  price.  The 
plethora  of  choices  is  one  explanation  of  the  many  poor  selections.  The  best 
decisions follow when the purpose is most clearly defined. At least the decision 
maker then knows exactly what he is trying to achieve and why. 
The  Swiss  were  trying  to  achieve  survival  -  an  aim  so  ‘transcendent’  that  the 
“why” needn’t be asked. The only important question was “How,” and the only 
answer (which their Japanese rivals have always chosen  as the most  rewarding 
approach) is to probe for weakness of the opposition, and then to kick the Achilles 
heel with steel-tipped boots. In this instance, the weakness (to which Japanese 
business  is  strangely  prone)  was  lack of modern  fashion  sense.  The  electronic 
timepieces  were  being  sold  as  wrist  machinery;  that  gave  Swiss  Company  its 
opportunity. 

Q. 1 In the context of the passage which of the following is closest in meaning

Q.2.  Which of the following was true in the case of business difficulties of the 

Swiss watch makers as per the passage ? 
(1)  The Swiss watch maker had virtually no limitation of available

(2)  A large number of available alternatives would have probably 

made the Swiss Watch makers’ 
decision making process better. 

(3)  The limited number of available choices in the instant situation 
made the Swiss Watch makers’ decision making process easier. 

(4)  The Swiss watch makers lacked clarity about the objective to be achieved.

to  wrist watches because of their modern fashion sense. 

(2)  In the past, Swiss watch companies were always probing for the 

weakness of their rival Japanese companies to succeed in 
competition. 

(3)  The Japanese watch companies were having tough time from their strong 

Swiss rivals.
